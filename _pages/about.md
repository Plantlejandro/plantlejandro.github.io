Welcome! I’m Alejo, a Ph.D. candidate in Geosciences at The Pennsylvania State University working with Dr. [Peter Wilf](https://www.geosc.psu.edu/directory/peter-wilf/). My research explores the evolution and assembly of rainforests, with a focus on paleobotany and plant-insect interactions. 

Through field and museum-based research across the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia, I investigate fossil floras and insect herbivory to uncover deep-time biogeographic connections. I’m passionate about sharing science through teaching, mentorship, and outreach.

About me
======
I had the fortune to be born and raised in Colombia, a country filled with lush, green
forests and one of the most biodiverse regions of the world. I remember going for long hikes with my siblings and being amazed by the forests, the dense mist that condensed in the bark of trees, the huge heart-shaped leaves (that I now know belong to the genus _Xanthosoma_) of the understory, and an almost infinite color palette of flowers. This appreciation for nature, passed down to me by my mom, left a big impression on me and became one of the main reasons I pursued a bachelor's degree in biology at the Universidad EAFIT.

During the third year of my undergrad, I took a paleontology class and was immediately hooked. I did not even know there were such things as fossil plants! I was attracted to the weirdness of fossils and thinking in timescales that my brain still struggles to comprehend.

For my undergrad thesis, and as a Short Term Fellow at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, I studied the feeding traces that insects left on some of the earliest Neotropical rainforests; the closest we can get to reconstructing the ecology of plant-insect interactions 58 Ma in the past. I was mentored by Dr. [Mónica Carvalho](https://lsa.umich.edu/paleontology/people/curators/monica-carvalho.html)

I then moved to the Pennsylvania State University to conduct a M.S. with Dr. [Peter Wilf](https://www.geosc.psu.edu/directory/peter-wilf), testing whether the insect herbivore traces observed in 52 Ma _Eucalyptus_ fossils from Patagonia coincide with those observed in extant gum trees.

I stayed at Penn State for my Ph.D., and am currently working on describing plant fossils from the Eocene Anglesea flora of southeastern Australia, understanding the assembly of Australian rainforests through time, and testing the validity of morphological measurements of stomatal complexes to estimate humidity in deep time.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a fieldwork or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
